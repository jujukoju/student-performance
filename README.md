##ðŸ“š Student GPA Prediction
This project predicts a student's GPA (Grade Point Average) based on inputs like age, gender, study time, absences, and tutoring support using a Decision Tree Regressor.

##ðŸš€ Libraries
Pandas
NumPy 
Scikit-learn 

##ðŸ“¥ Inputs Used
The model predicts GPA based on the following features:
Age: Student's age (years)
Gender: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
StudyTimeWeekly: Average study time per week (hours)
Absences: Total number of absences
Tutoring: 0 = No tutoring, 1 = Receives tutoring

The target output is:
GPA: Student's academic GPA score

##ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation Metrics
After prediction, the model reports:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RÂ² Score

These metrics help assess the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.
